# CodeJam - With SAP Build, Create Apps, Processes, and Business Sites Without Coding

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/build-codejam)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/build-codejam)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on using **SAP Build** to create a process, an app, and a business site. 

Specifically, you will get to know the environment by creating:

* A sales order approval process (**SAP Build Process Automation**).
* An app that lets users specify sales order data and trigger that process (**SAP Build Apps**).
* A business site in which you will embed that app (**SAP Build Work Zone**).

### What you will build

You will build an application that allows a user to enter sales order data, and then allows a manager to approve the sales order. To make all this simpler for the user, you will embed the app inside a business website along with other related apps and tools.

To accomplish this, you will create 3 inter-related parts using for each one of the SAP Build tools:

- First, you will create the process with SAP Build Process Automation for taking sales order details, which will send a request for approval to the manager.
- Second, you will create an app with SAP Build Apps that allows a user to enter sales order details and sends the data to the process and triggers the process.
- And third, you will create a workspace in SAP Build Work Zone and embed the app there.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this ðŸ‘‰ throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).
