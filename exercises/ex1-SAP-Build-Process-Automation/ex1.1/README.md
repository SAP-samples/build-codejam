# Exercise 1.1 - Create Sales Order Business Process 

In this exercise, we use SAP Build Process Automation to create a simple process for approving a sales order.

![Process](../../../images/ex1.1/process.png)

The process receives the sales order details and then either:

- Automatically approves the sales order if it is below a certain threshold.
  
- Sends an approval form to the specified approver. Once the approver approves, the process ends.

### Questions for Discussion

- Within an SAP Build Process Automation project, what types of artifacts can you create, and why would you need each one?
  - Where can I see all the available artifacts?
- Within a process, what types of steps can you create?
- Both the Condition step and the Decision step let you analyze the data in your process and make your process dynamic. What is the difference between those 2 step types?
