In this exercise, we use SAP Build Process Automation to create a simple process for approving a sales order.

When making the app, you will:

- Create the UI.
- Set up a connection to the SAP Build Process Automation API.
- Test the connection.
- Create a data variable to hold the sales order details and bind it to the UI.
- Create a button and add logic to trigger the workflow. 

## Exercises

Perform all the steps in ðŸ‘‰ tutorial: 

- [Create SAP Build App to Trigger Workflow](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/build-apps-workflow-trigger.html)


## Summary

You have now created a simple app that lets users enter sales order details and trigger an approval process.

Next, we will improve the app by letting users select the product in a dropdown list instead of typing in the product code.

### Questions for Discussion

- What types of data resources can you connect to?

- What type of styling and layouting can you do in your app?

- Why do you need data variables if you create a data resource? In other words, what is the purpose of a data resource and what is the purpose of a data variable?
