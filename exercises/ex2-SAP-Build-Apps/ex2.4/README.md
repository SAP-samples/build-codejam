# Exercise 2.4 - Deploy SAP Build App to SAP BTP

In this exercise, we will build the app and deploy it to SAP BTP to make it available to our users, and to make it available to be embedded into SAP Build Work Zone.

>A few things to note:
>- You must be a member of the Cloud Foundry org and space to which you are deploying.
>- When deploying, you will have to log into Cloud Foundry using the same credentials as you used for logging into SAP BTP originally. But you must indicate the Identity Provider, and for this we provided you the **origin key** to indicate the IDP.

**IMPORTANT:** The build and deploy take some time, so after starting the build you should proceed to the SAP Build Work Zone exercises, starting with [Exercise 3.1 - Add a Workspace to SAP Build Work Zone](/exercises/ex3-SAP-Build-Work-Zone/ex3.1/README.md). After 15 minutes check whether the build finished ... if so, then start the deploy.

### Questions for Discussion

- Where can you deploy an SAP Build Apps project? Where would you want to?

- Instead of using the deploy button of SAP Build Apps, how else could you deploy the app?
