# Getting Setup with the SAP Build Lobby

The SAP Build lobby is the starting point for all your SAP Build activities, whichever tool you will be using.

To get setup, you will be given the following:

- Credentials for signing into SAP BTP
- Link to open the lobby
- Link to the SAP BTP cockpit (just to check your deployed app)
- Link to the SAP Business Application Studio
- An origin key (just for deploying your app when asked to sign in â€“ this will be explained in the session)

>All destinations and the mail server have been setup for you. You will NOT need to create these. 

## Sign into the lobby

Get the URL from your instructor, as well as your credentials. Then go to the lobby, and you will likely need to sign in.

## Explore the lobby

The lobby shows you all your projects and all the projects that were shared with you.

Explorer the filtering capability (the filter icon is on the far right of the page), as well as the options for individual projects.

You can:

- Set who can work on the project (Manage Members).
- Rename the project.
- Delete the project
- ... and more.

## See what you can create

In the lobby, if you click create, you will be able to see all the types of projects you can build.

Some of the options may be disabled, either because they are not installed on your tenant or you do not have permissions to create them.



## Summary

Now that you have access to the SAP Build lobby, you can start building your apps and business processes.


### Questions for further study

- In the lobby, find how you can filter and sort projects. What kind of filters/sorts would be helpful?
  
- For SAP Build Apps projects, what actions can you take? How might you make use of these capabilities?

- If you want to use a project exported from another tenant and sent to you, how would you make use of it?  

- Notice all the project types you can create. How might you make use of them.
