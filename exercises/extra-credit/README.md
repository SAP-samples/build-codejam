# Extra Credit: Date Field 

The formal exercises for the Code Jam are completed. But in case you want to continue to learn, we have provided a few addition challenges to extend what you've already done and to teach some important concepts or features.

In this exercise, you will upgrade the app you created to send sales order to your process, but add a date picker instead of requiring people to type in the date.

This will teach you about the Marketplace of more complex components and flow functions, and specifically about the **Date** field. 

## Exercise

For now, we won't give all the detailed instructions, but we will give you an outline of what you need to do.

1. Go to Marketplace and install the **Date field**.

2. Add a **Date field** next to the input field for the date.

    ![Marketplace](DateField/date2.png)

3. Remove the **Label** text.

4. Configure the containers and **Date field** so the calendar will display.

    - In the 2 containers that contain the **Date field**, set the **Layout > Layout > Clip Overflowing Content** property to **No**.

    - In the 2 containers that contain the **Date field**, set the **Layout > Position > Z-Index** to **1**.

5. Now we have to get the selected value into our data variable. We will not set the **Selected value** property but do this through an event.

    Select the Date field. Select the event **Property 'Selected value' changed** and attach to it a **Set data variable** flow function.

    ![Create event](DateField/setdate1.png)

    Click on the **Set data variable** flow function.
    
    ![Create event](DateField/setdatavariable.png)

    For the **Data variable name**, select our data variable.

    For the **Record properties**, click on **Custom object** to reveal a single binding for the `salesorderdetails` field.

    ![Create event](DateField/setdate2.png)

    Set binding to the following formula:

    ```JavaScript
    SET_KEY(DEFAULT(data["Trigger Workflow1"].salesorderdetails, {}),"expectedDeliveryDate", FORMAT_DATETIME_LOCAL(self.value,"YYYY-MM-DD"))   
    ```

    >**QUESTION:** What does the formula do? And why does the formula editor show an error?

At this point you could get rid of the old input box for the date field, and stylize the UI.

## Summary

You have now installed the Date field from the Marketplace, added it to your app, configured it so it appears properly, and configured it so the selected date will be sent to your sales order process.
