# Extra Credit (lucky you!)

The formal exercises for the code jam are completed. But in case you want to continue to learn, we have provided a few addition challenges to extend what you've already done and to teach some important concepts or features.


## Exercises 

* [Add date picker to your sales order app](/exercises/extra-credit/DatePicker/README.md)
  
    In the sales order app, we had a field for the expected delivery, but it used an input box -- the user had to know the format and type it in manually. Instead, we can use the Date Picker component to let the user pick the date.

* [Create a custom component and share it](/exercises/extra-credit/SharingComponents/README.md)

    Creating custom components and sharing them with others is an advanced but important skill. In this standalone exercise you'll create a quick stopwatch component that you will share with other projects.
